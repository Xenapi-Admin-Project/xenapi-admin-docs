Managing VMs

There are options available to managing virtual machines including starting, pausing, rebooting, and deleting them. 

To see a list of virtual machines, use the xe vm-list command. The list can be filtered based on parameter values. For example, xe vm-list power-state=halted will only display a list of virtual machines that are halted. Another example would be xe vm-list params=name-label, power-state to get the name and its power state of each virtual machine. All VMs are uniquely identified by their UUIDs.

Starting VMs
To start a VM, type xe vm-start uuid=<VM UUID>.

To start all VMs based on a parameter value (e.g. power-state=halted), type xe vm-start power-state=halted --multiple

Pausing/Unpausing VMs
Pausing a VM is not the same as suspending a VM. Pausing will not free (or release) the memory used by the VM(s). 

To pause a VM, type xe vm-pause uuid=<VM UUID>.

To unpause and start the VM again, type xe vm-unpause uuid=<VM UUID>.

Rebooting VMs
A VM will reboot if its power state is running. To check the power state of all VMs, type xe vm-list params=uuid,power-state.

To reboot a VM, type xe-reboot uuid=<VM UUID>

Consoling into VMs
First, check to see if the VM is running before a console command can be used.

For versions 1.0/1.1:
1. Start the VM
xe vm-start uuid=<VM UUID>
2. Get the VM's domain ID
DOMID=$(xe vm-list uuid=<VMUUID> params=dom-id --minimal)
3. Use the xenconsole command
/usr/lib/xen/bin/xenconsole ${DOMID}

For versions 1.5/1.6:
1. Start the VM
xe vm-start uuid=<VM UUID>
2. Use the xe console command
xe console vm=<name or UUID>

Deleting VMs

To delete a VM and its disk(s), type xe vm-uninstall uuid=<VM UUID>.

Importing/Exporting VMs

To export an existing VM, type xe vm-export uuid=<VM UUID> filename=<PATH TO FILE>. A new filename must be given, and by default, it is saved in the current directory unless a filepath is given. XCP displays errors if an existing file is used for exporting VMs. Citrix recommends to have the file use the .xva extension.

To import a VM using a file, type xe vm-import filename=<PATH TO FILE>. XCP assigns a new UUID for the imported VM. Use the xe vm-list command to confirm the import process.

*consider server type? (xe help mentioned server type)

Shutting down VMs
To shutdown a VM, type xe vm-shutdown uuid=<VM UUID>

The options, force and multiple, can be used in conjunction with the vm-* commands:

Option	         Description
--force          Forces the operation to be performed on the VM and bypasses system warnings
--multiple       Perform the operation on multiple VMs
