XCP Networking

Networks 

What is a network?

A network is a virtual ethernet switch on a XCP host.

Types of networks

	* single-server private networks - is an internal network with no connection to the outside world that allows virtual machines to communicate on a XCP host.										
	* cross-server private networks - functions much like a single-server private network, but allows VMs on different hosts to commuciate.
	* external networks - are networks that provide a connection to the outside world through a PIF.
	* vlans - are networks that are connected to a physical VLAN.
	* bonded networks - are networks that provide a connection to the outside world through a bonded interface.

How to create a network?

	* xe network-create creates an internal network with no connection to the outside world.
	
How to remove a network?

	* xe network-destroy destroys a network. In order to successfully remove a network, active PIFS must be removed, VIFs detached, and VLANs removed. Use *xe pif-forget* to remove PIFs, *xe vif-unplug* to detach VIFs, and *xe vlan-destroy* to remove VLANs.

What is a PIF?

	* A physical interface (PIF) represents a physical NIC on a XCP host. A PIF has a name, a description, a unique UUID, and other parameters that contain information about its network and host.

Types of PIFs

We classify PIFs based on their configuration.

	*	Primary management interface (PIF) - The PMI PIF is specified durning the install of XCP. It provideds a interface for your XCP host to connect to your network and carrie management traffic to other hosts in your pool.
	
	*	Management - A management PIF is a PIF with IP addressing configured.
	
How to create a PIF?
	
	* PIFs are assosiated with physical NICs, so when you first install XCP, for every physical NIC found on the XCP host a PIF with a network is created. 	
	
	* To add a new PIF: Install the physical NIC, restart the server, run the xe pif-scan command, and a new PIF and network will be created.


VIFS

What is a VIF?
	
	A virtual interface (VIF) is virtual NIC that allows a VM to connect to a network.
	
How to create a VIF?

	xe vif-create will create a new VIF and connect it to a network. If the VM is running, you need to attach it to the VM using xe vif-plug, and VIFs created on a halted VM will be attached on VM startup.
