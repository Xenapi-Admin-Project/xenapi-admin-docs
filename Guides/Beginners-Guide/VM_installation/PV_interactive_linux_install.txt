PV interactive Linux installation





1. Getting the network info

This line gets the Network UUID for xenbr0. If you're using a different bridge you will want to insert it here. Get a list of XCP networks with xe network-list. This network is connected to the outside interface. This tutorial requires there to be a DHCP server on this network answering requests and providing network access to the Internet.



NETUUID=$(xe network-list bridge=xenbr0 --minimal)



2. Creating the VM and setting parameters

Here we create the VM from the RHEL6 template, create a network interface and add it to our network from step one. Additional settings are for configuring the install repository and specifying the kickstart file from my site. The last setting turns off VNC so we can watch the install via a text console (very important in my environment).  Even if you can't see all the text below just highlight and paste. The text is there even if it's not visible.


We need to grab the UUID of the Red Hat 6 64-bit template. To grab the template UUID:
	TMPLUUID=$(xe template-list | grep -B1 'name-label.*Red Hat.* 6.*64-bit' | awk -F: '/uuid/{print $2}'| tr -d " ")

Now that we have the UUID of the template, we can create our VM. To create the VM:
	VMUUID=$(xe vm-install new-name-label="CentOS6" template=${TMPLUUID})


With the VM created, we need to add a virtual interface (VIF) to the VM, so the VM has network connectivity and access to the internet. The VIF will be attached to network specified in step one. 

To create the VIF:
	xe vif-create vm-uuid=$VMUUID network-uuid=$NETUUID mac=random device=0
	
vif-create will return the UUID of the new VIF. We can use xe vif-param-list to view the parameters of the VIF. Please note, the xe command supports tab completion, so you don't need to try and type the entire UUID. 

To list the VIF parameters:
	xe vif-param-list uuid=<YOUR VIF UUID>

Let's set the install repository for the VM, so we can begin the network installation.

To set the install-repository:
	xe vm-param-set uuid=$VMUUID other-config:install-repository=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64
	
		
3. Starting the VM and installing CentOS
	
With all the parameters set, it's time to begin the installation. 

To start up the VM:
	xe vm-start uuid=$VMUUID
	
Now that the VM is started, let's connect to the console and proceed with the interactive install

To connect to the VM's console:
	xe console uuid=$VMUUID
	
5. Shutting down the VM 


To shutdown the VM:
xe vm-shutdown uuid=$VMUUID


6. Export our VM for safe keeping

To back up the CentOS machine:

xe vm-export uuid=$VMUUID filename=CentOS6-base.xva















































































// This is the crap I wrote before, It's useless but didn't want to dispose of it. -matt

We are going to create a Cent OS 6.3 64bit VM from XCP's VM templates. The Cent OS VM will be a network install using the Cent OS repositories. This installation will require a XCP network with an Internet gateway, so we can access the repositories during the installation. We will be entering all the commands on the XCP host's command line.

Our first step will to be to create the VM using XCP's VM templates. We are going to use the vm-install command. If you want to supply your own name-label for this virtual machine supply it using the new-name-label parameter (enclose the name in quotes if it contains spaces). 

To create the VM type: 
	xe vm-install new-name-label="Cent OS" template=CentOS\ 6\ \(64-bit\) 

After the command is complete, the UUID of the VM will be returned. 


Now that the virtual machine is created, we need to create a VIF interface to allow the VM to communicate with the Cent OS repositories. This requires the new VM's UUID and the UUID of the network with an Internet gateway. Also because the VM was recently created we are safe to supply the device parameter with a 0.

To create the VIF type:
	xe vif-create network-uuid=<Network UUID> vm-uuid=<VM UUID> device=0

After the command is complete, the UUID of the VIF will be returned. 


With the VM having network access we need to add the Cent OS repositories to the VM's parameters. The URL for the 64-bit repositories is:  http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/

To add the install repositories to vm parameters type:
	xe vm-param-set uuid=<VM UUID> other-config:install-repository=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/x86_64/


Lets start up the VM, connect to the console, and proceed with the installation. 

To start up the VM type: 
	xe vm-start uuid=<VM UUID>

To connect to the VM's console type:
	xe console uuid=<VM UUID>

You can now proceed with the Cent OS installation. When Cent OS is finished with the installation the VM will reboot. You can connect to the VM again using the xe console command to configure your VM.
