** Interactive Network Cent OS 6.3 install via xe console **

DRAFT OUTLINE

TOPICS

1) Present an intro to the user about what we are going to cover.
	*Interactive install (e.g. no kickstart install script)
	*Cent OS 6.3 via network repos
	*Use Cent OS 6.0 64bit VM template
	*Use Local SR. Should we explain to the user what a local SR is? 
		// Perhaps just use the DEFAULT SR and avoid the conversation - Grant
	*Explain the network configuration
		// *Explain how to tab for UUID and/or copy paste otherwise people will be typing them in with errors - Grant

	
2) Create the Cent OS VM
	* Create the Cent OS 6.3 VM via template
		- $xe vm-install new-name-label="Cent_OS_VM" template=<Cent OS 64bit 6.0 template> sr-uuid=<SR UUID>
			// assign the UUID to a variable so they don't have to keep typing it in. Sometimes we can use more friendly commands
			// like xe vm-list name-label=CentOS6 but other times we HAVE to use the nasty UUID.
	* Explain to the user how $xe vm-install operates
		- It creates a VM object, VDI object, and a VBD object. // ie. creates a Computer, a Disk and connects them.
	* Show the user how to use some low level commands to view the objects created by $xe vm-install 
		- $xe vm-param-list uuid=<VM UUID> will display all the new VMs parameters.
		- $xe vbd-param-list vm-uuid=<VM UUID> will display the VBD created and all the parameters
		- $xe vdi-param-list uuid=<VDI UUID> will display the VDI created and all the parameters

	
	
3) Hook up our new Cent OS VM to a network
	* Instruct the user how to display networks present on the host. We need to select the one on the same subnet as the internet gateway.
		- $xe network-list
	* Once the network uuid is found, we create the VIF.
		- $xe vif-create vm-uuid=<VM UUID> network-uuid=<Network UUID> device=0
	* Should we show the user how to view the newly created VIF? // yes - Grant
		- $xe vm-vif-list uuid=<VM UUID> 


4) Set the Cent OS install repo
	* We need to set the VM to use the Cent OS 64bit 6.3 network repo for a network install to work correctly.
		- $xe vm-param-set uuid=<VM UUID> other-config:install-repo=<URL>
	* Should we show the user how to view if the parameter was set correctly?

5) Start up the VM and connect to the console
		* $xe vm-start uuid=<VM UUID>
			- use $xe vm-list to show the user how to view the status of a VM
		* $xe console uuid=<VM UUID>

6) Guide the user through the interactive Cent OS install
	* Should we even bother with this? I mean any idiot should be able to install Cent OS.
		// Probably not
	

7) Show the user how to start and shutdown the new VM.
	* $xe vm-start uuid=<VM UUID>
	* $xe vm-shutdown uuid=<VM UUID>
	* $xe console uuid=<VM UUID>
	
8) Backing up the VM.
	* Should we cover backing up a VM??
		// xe vm-export?
		// xe vm-snapshot?
