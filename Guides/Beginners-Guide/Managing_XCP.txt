Managing XCP

Currently there are multiple ways to manage XCP hosts.

1. commandline via xe

There are over 300 xe commands available to manage XCP.
Use "xe help --all" to see the entire list of xe commands.

The commands are broken into the following groups. Some of them may not be available depending on the version of XCP:

xe appliance-*: appliance commands
xe bond-*: bond commands
xe cd-*: cd commands
xe gpu-group-*: GPU group commands
xe host-*: host commands
xe log-*: log commands
xe network-*: network commands
xe pool-*: pool commands
xe sr-*: storage repository commands
xe vbd-*: virtual block device commands
xe vdi-*: virtual disk image commands
xe vm-*: virtual machine commands

2. xsconsole

To use xsconsole, type "xsconsole" on the command line. It displays a menu that lists the options to view system information and add a host to a resource pool, for example. 

To ensure that xsconsole will run without errors, maximize the size of the terminal.

Use the arrow keys to navigate or scroll down to "Quit" to exit xsconsole.

3. XenCenter

XenCenter is installed on Windows operating systems only.

XenCenter can be downloaded from the third-party website at http://citrix-xencenter.software.informer.com/. Click on the large green rectangle on the left that says “Trusted Download” to start the downloading process.

Once XenCenter is installed, run the program and add an XCP host to manage.

An XCP host can be added to XenCenter in two ways:

a. From the home screen (?), click on the server image that says "Add..."

b. From the menu, click on Server --> Add...

Then type the IP address or hostname of the XCP on the local network. (What about remote?)
