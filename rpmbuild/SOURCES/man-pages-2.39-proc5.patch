+(Explanation for Linux 2.6)
+For processes running a real-time scheduling policy
+.RI ( policy
+below; see
+.BR sched_setscheduler (2)),
+this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one;
+that is, a number in the range \-2 to \-100,
+corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99.
+For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
+this is the raw nice value
+.RB ( setpriority (2))
+as represented in the kernel.
+The kernel stores nice values as numbers
+in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),
+corresponding to the user-visible nice range of \-20 to 19.

+Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
+the scheduler weighting given to this process.
+.\" And back in kernel 1.2 days things were different again.

 The nice value ranges from 19 (nicest) to \-19 (not nice to others).
