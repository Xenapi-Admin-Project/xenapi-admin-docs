-This (read-only) file
-gives the number of files presently opened.
-It contains three numbers: The number of allocated
-file handles, the number of free file handles and the maximum
-number of file handles.  The kernel allocates file handles dynamically, 
-but it
-doesn't free them again.  If the number of allocated files is close to the 
-
-maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
-When the number of free file handles is
-large, you've encountered a peak in your usage of file
-handles and you probably don't need to increase the maximum.
+Historically, the three values in file-nr denoted the number of
+allocated file handles, the number of allocated but unused file
+handles, and the maximum number of file handles. Linux 2.6 always
+reports 0 as the number of free file handles -- this is not an error,
+it just means that the number of allocated file handles exactly
+matches the number of used file handles.
